            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello I'm Yudha. I'm a PhD student in International Biotech and Healthcare Management, Taipei Medical University. 
                My current thesis is predicting colorectal cancer using real world data such as electronic health records. 
                My current research interest is digital health.
            Beside playing with data, I love Walking, Cycling, and Japanese Pop Culture. Nice to meet you!</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Herewith I post some of my recent projects that made into publications or conferences that related into my academics.
            But it's still far from enough :p</p>

                <p>After we got our feedback from practicioners, CRLM is more concerning than HCC. Thus that, we pivoted to CRLM.
Liver Metastases is one of the most prevalent malignacies that cause mortality among colorectal cancer patients
where 25-30% affected by the malignancy worldwide. Predicting the occurrence of colorectal cancer liver metastases
(CRLM) could benefiting physician on deciding the diagnoses. We create a prediction model by using machine learning on
the electronic health record to discover susceptible characteristics for secondary malignant neoplasm of liver cancer in
colorectal cancer patients.</p>

                <p> Liver is a common organ target of metastasis for colorectal cancer, which indicates the possibility of
nonmetastasis cancer. We create a prediction model by using machine learning on the electronic
health record to discover susceptible characteristics for liver cancer in colorectal cancer patients.</p>

                <p> Pandemic situations changes everything. In 2022, with Indonesia Student Overseas Association, we created a brief on how digital health help to cope with COVID-19 around certain countries.</p>
